Drinking my tea
Without sugar-
No difference.
										
Mayan head in a
Pacific driftwood bole
-Someday I'll live in N.Y.
			
Looking over my shoulder
my shadow covered
with cherry blossoms.
				
I didn't know the names 
of the flowers-now
my garden is gone.
					
I slapped the mosquito
and missed.
What made me do that?
					
Reading haiku
I am unhappy,
longing for the Nameless.
					
A frog floating 
in the drugstore jar:
summer rain on grey pavements.
					
On the porch
in my shorts;
auto lights in the rain.
					
Another year
has past-the world
is no different.
					
The first thing I looked for 
in my old garden was
The Cherry Tree.
					
My old desk:
the first thing I looked for
in my house.
					
My early journal:
the first thing I found
in my old desk.
									
I quit shaving
but the eyes that glanced at me
remained in the mirror.
					
The madman 
emerges from the movies:
the street at lunchtime.
					
Cities of boys
are in their graves,
and in this town...
					
Lying on my side
in the void:
the breath in my nose.
					
On the fifteenth floor
the dog chews a bone-
Screech of taxicabs.
								
The moon over the roof,
worms in the garden.
I rent this house.

Biting off
more than I can chew —
a broken wisdom tooth.

Daily rain
from the deep well
this glass of water.

I sit, still.
The canyon river chants, 
moving mountains.

Thousands of leaves
shake in the breeze —
empty sky.

One not two,
two not one —
legs on a snake.

ticking my life away
indifferent clocks
everywhere

Setting potted figs
along the warm southern wall —
a goose flaps by.

An awakening
I hear the truth —
gray rain on clay.

rain-soaked
olive branches droop,
ground fogs rise

Lost on Mt. Sumeru
coming down —
the taste of snowflakes. 

cold midnight
pounding rain —
only ghosts about

Gathering dust,
an iron idol
just sits.

Meanings lost
in the saying —
the mystic's dilemma

Not a leafbud
in a blue oak grove —
shadowless winter noon.

A frog floats
belly up —
dead silence.

no chanting
no Temple bells —
wind-chimes swaying

December fog —
among the leaves
a dead frog.  

sunlight breaks
cold silence
a meadowlark trills

One week later
Six Directions of Green
Billions of leaf-buds.

Red-winged blackbirds
pecking in the feeder —
I lost myself there.   

Last day of Spring,
ripe purple plums drop —
form is emptiness.

First day of Summer,
ditch completely dry —
emptiness is form.

Worldwide
many suffer —
even as peaches ripen.

Exactly at noon —
the branch cracks,
loaded with peaches.

evening breeze —
yellow poplar leaves
letting go

Up in an old oak
a woodpecker knocks —
the sky opens.

good North, good South
good East, good West,
good here, bad wherever

moonlight calms
the frozen night —
long silence
