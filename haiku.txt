Drinking my tea
Without sugar-
No difference.
										
Mayan head in a
Pacific driftwood bole
-Someday I'll live in N.Y.
			
Looking over my shoulder
my shadow covered
with cherry blossoms.
				
I didn't know the names 
of the flowers-now
my garden is gone.
					
I slapped the mosquito
and missed.
What made me do that?
					
Reading haiku
I am unhappy,
longing for the Nameless.
					
A frog floating 
in the drugstore jar:
summer rain on grey pavements.
					
On the porch
in my shorts;
auto lights in the rain.
					
Another year
has past-the world
is no different.
					
The first thing I looked for 
in my old garden was
The Cherry Tree.
					
My old desk:
the first thing I looked for
in my house.
					
My early journal:
the first thing I found
in my old desk.
									
I quit shaving
but the eyes that glanced at me
remained in the mirror.
					
The madman 
emerges from the movies:
the street at lunchtime.
					
Cities of boys
are in their graves,
and in this town...
					
Lying on my side
in the void:
the breath in my nose.
					
On the fifteenth floor
the dog chews a bone-
Screech of taxicabs.
								
The moon over the roof,
worms in the garden.
I rent this house.

Biting off
more than I can chew —
a broken wisdom tooth.

Daily rain
from the deep well
this glass of water.

I sit, still.
The canyon river chants, 
moving mountains.

Thousands of leaves
shake in the breeze —
empty sky.

One not two,
two not one —
legs on a snake.

ticking my life away
indifferent clocks
everywhere

Setting potted figs
along the warm southern wall —
a goose flaps by.

An awakening
I hear the truth —
gray rain on clay.

rain-soaked
olive branches droop,
ground fogs rise

Lost on Mt. Sumeru
coming down —
the taste of snowflakes. 

cold midnight
pounding rain —
only ghosts about

Gathering dust,
an iron idol
just sits.

Meanings lost
in the saying —
the mystic's dilemma

Not a leafbud
in a blue oak grove —
shadowless winter noon.

A frog floats
belly up —
dead silence.

no chanting
no Temple bells —
wind-chimes swaying

December fog —
among the leaves
a dead frog.  

sunlight breaks
cold silence
a meadowlark trills

One week later
Six Directions of Green
Billions of leaf-buds.

Red-winged blackbirds
pecking in the feeder —
I lost myself there.   

Last day of Spring,
ripe purple plums drop —
form is emptiness.

First day of Summer,
ditch completely dry —
emptiness is form.

Worldwide
many suffer —
even as peaches ripen.

Exactly at noon —
the branch cracks,
loaded with peaches.

evening breeze —
yellow poplar leaves
letting go

Up in an old oak
a woodpecker knocks —
the sky opens.

good North, good South
good East, good West,
good here, bad wherever

moonlight calms
the frozen night —
long silence

Beyond
the scarecrow's reach —
the Milky Way.

completely
finished —
a death poem

Dry wind —
the sweetness
of the last cherry.

An acorn falls —
six generations
cooled in the shade.

Leaf after leaf
turns yellow;
the fall of summer.

Last day of Winter,
leafless walnut trees —
form is emptiness.

First day of Spring,
clear sky to Mt. Shasta —
emptiness is form.

Daybreak —
forms are forms, 
emptiness is speechless.

No stars or orchards,
Only ground fog
Rising everywhere.

Shadowless dusk
growing colder–
squealing teakettle. 

A dog barks at nothing,
a thousand ducks twitch–
winds of winter.  

Flocks of white
geese in the light gray fog–
this way and that way.

Interview with the master, over before it began;
He rings the bell, next dokusan.

January sun–
puddle after puddle
becomes mud.

Red berries
on evergreenss–
Chinese New Year

Ripping out
a walnut orchard–
diesel smoke.  

Mother and son
hand in hand–
a gentle rain.

Bulbs, dirt rows,
the noonday sun–
but where is the One?  

Somehow
wrinkled and gray–
another decade. 

A dog barks at nothing,
a thousand ducks twitch–
winds of winter.

Circled round by
snowcapped peaks–
white blossoms.  

Grown old I groan
At times so stiff and sore
But not stopping, stepping on,
Walking past the pains to gain
Another epiphany before the rains.

Step by step the breath
Finds a pleasant pace
Pains dissipate.

By the third mile, I smile,
Feet flowing, arms swaying,
discomforts dissolved.

Warmed with eyes wide
Trees slide by, doves coo,
Awe opens then closes - no clues.

My pace slowly slows 
Avoiding holes in the road;
Filling the unconscious crevasses of my mind
With pleasures deep and kind.

By and by, it's done, I'm saying
"Such a benefit, and beguiled."
I now rest, content.

Branches in blossom
shake to the rhythms of wind–
bees on rosemary.

A twigless
pecan stick;
working underground.

Midnight
Counting Crows
to stay awake. 

Alive with bees ...
radiant pink
peach blossoms.

 

 

dark barn -
a ray of light
from roof to floor


Green beyond green
below gray skies,
brilliant forsythias.


a few flecks
of yellow–
forsythias awakening
